        <h1>Impact of Latitude on Weather</h1>
        <p>In this project we wanted to take a look at some weather data to see what impacts latitude had on weather. In particular, we will be looking at the following observations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The relationship between the Max Observed Temperature and Latitude for cities located in the Northern Hemisphere</li>
            <li>The relationship between the Max Observed Temperature and Latitude for cities located in the Southern Hemisphere</li>
            <li>The relationship between Humidity and Latitude for cities located in the Northern Hemisphere</li>
            <li>The relationship between Humidity and Latitude for cities located in the Southern Hemisphere</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For this analysis, we generated a random list of over 500 cities and pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API.</p>
        <p>Once we analyzed the data, we used Matplotlib to vizualize the relationships between the various aspects of weather and a citie's latitude. This site provides the source data and the vizualization we created to display these relationships. Additionally, we have included explanations and descriptions of any trends we observed.</p>
