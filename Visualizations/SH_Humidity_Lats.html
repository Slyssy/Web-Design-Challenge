        <p>The r squared value for this linear regression is also quite low suggesting that there is little correlation between latitude and humidity levels. However, just like in the Northern Hemisphere, one can still see there is still something going on here. Although humidity levels do appear to be dispearsed throughout, you can still see that most of the lower humidity levels are grouped together between about -10 and -30 degrees latitude. This consistent with the location of many of the world's deserts.</p>
